This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).

I am part of a research and development team at Intel Corporation specializing in machine learning and computer vision.  As a platform architect, I help define and build next generation hardware-software solutions to improve user experience and utility of personal computing devices.
